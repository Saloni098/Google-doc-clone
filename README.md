Implemented using Reactjs, Quill, Socket.io and MongoDB. Don't know how that works? Follow along!<br>

<b>Reactjs :</b>
For the front-end of the editor (it looks basic but yeah). It allowed me to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the application's state.

<br>

<b>Socket.io :</b>
Socket.io is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the web server and clients. It is commonly used in collaborative applications like Google Docs clones to enable real-time editing and updates across multiple users.



<b>Quill :</b> It is an API driven rich text editor. It was used for generating a text editor like interface. Granular access to the editor's content, changes and events through a simple API. Works consistently and deterministically with JSON as both input and output.

<b>MongoDB :</b>
It is a document database which made easy to store structured or unstructured data. It uses a JSON-like format to store documents.

## Getting Started:

##### npm start
<br>
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

* Play along to dicover its features in real time.
* Happy coding!ðŸ“Ž
